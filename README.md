# 🎤 Voice Chatbot Web App (Flask + Speech Recognition + TTS)

This project is a **voice-enabled chatbot** built with Python and Flask.  
It runs in the browser, captures voice input via the Web Speech API, sends it to a Flask backend, and replies using rule-based logic. The reply is spoken aloud using the system’s TTS engine.

---

## ✅ Features

- 🎙️ Voice input from browser (via Web Speech API)
- 💬 Rule-based chatbot responses
- 🔊 Replies spoken via `pyttsx3` (Python text-to-speech)
- 🧠 Lightweight and works offline (no OpenAI/GPT dependency)
- 🖼️ Clean and responsive web UI
- 📝 Chat history visible on the page

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-chatbot.git
cd voice-chatbot
````

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Run the App

```bash
python web_chatbot.py
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

Click the 🎤 "Start Talking" button and speak into your mic.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

* **Frontend**: Uses JavaScript's Web Speech API to capture voice
* **Backend**: Flask receives the text input and responds with rule-based logic
* **Output**: Python uses `pyttsx3` to speak the response aloud (from your machine)

## 📦 requirements.txt

```txt
Flask==3.0.2
SpeechRecognition==3.14.3
pyttsx3==2.90
pyaudio==0.2.14
```

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Add GPT-3.5/GPT-4 support via OpenAI API
* Use browser-based speech synthesis for full web-based interaction
* Add conversation memory or context tracking
* Deploy on cloud (Render, Heroku, etc.)
